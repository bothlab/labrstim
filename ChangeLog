	* laser_stimulation: Project created from older stimulation programs
	* make: Make it possible to compile and install the program using make
	* main.c: The phase of stimulation is much more precise.
	* main.c: The stimulation can last more than 15 ms.
	* comedi_code.c: laser_stimulation uses the same code as kacq to interface with AD card.
2011-03-03	Kevin Allen
	* main.c: Start to write the code for train of stimulation at a given frequency.
2011-03-09	Kevin Allen
	* main.c: Add support for long options.
	* main.h: Now include the config.h file generated by autotools
2011-03-16	Kevin Allen
	* configure.ac: Add library checks. All but comedi check is working.
2011-03-18	Kevin Allen
	* main.c: Add stimulation with random intervals
	* main.c: Options were modified, now use capital letters for some options
2011-03-21	Kevin Allen
	* main.c: Potential bug found but not fixed in theta stimulation. More laser pulses at 35 than 220 degree. Tina is not sure anymore.
	* main.c: For theta stimulation, if phase_difference is within acceptable range but negative, nanosleep and stimulate at right time
2011-04-07	Kevin Allen
	* fftw_function.c: Fix the code to calculate the phase difference
	* comedi_code.c: Fix the function that returns the most recent data from a single channel
	* main.c:	Change the theta stimulation code slightly so that its start when enough data has been acquired
	* configure.ac: The program can be installed with ./configure; make; make install
2011-06-04	Kevin Allen
	* main.c: Add the section to stimulate when there is a SWR. Now need testing.
2011-10-02	Kevin Allen
	* configure.ac: Move to autotools build system
	* main.c: add options and code to read from .dat files instead of from comedi device
	* main.c: David Dupret is doing some testing of swr detection in Oxford
2012-02-01	Kevin Allen
	* main.h: add comments to #define statments
	* fftw_function.c: change a denominator to calculate the mean square root of SWR
	* fftw_function.c: initialize an array to 0 in initialize section
	* testing: program was used by David Dupret in Oxford. They manage to detect some SWR. Still testing
2012-02-22	Kevin Allen
	* main.h: change the swr frequency to 125-250
	* fftw_function.c: found a bug in functions detecting theta/delta power and also swr power
	* main.c: change the code so I can run laser_stimulation on a computer that has no comedi drivers to test swr detection.
